// every line starts with an identifier
// every identifier is followed by a colon or an arrow
// if it's an arrow, the identifier is a group
// if it's a colon, the identifier is a variable
// an identifier and a group cannot have the same name
// trying to assign to a variable or group that already exists will change the original variable or group
// trying to assign to a variable or group that doesn't exist will create a new variable or group
// all statements end in newlines or EOF
// groups can be nested
// variables and groups can be referenced in other assignements but they must be defined in advance
